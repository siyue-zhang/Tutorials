# AWS SageMaker

Cloud machine-learning platform that helps users in building, training, tuning, and deploying machine-learning models in a production-ready hosted environment

## Benefits

* All ML components are stored in one place
* Highly scalable
* Trains model faster
* Maintains uptime
* High data security
* Simple data transfer

## Steps

1. Build 
2. Test and Tune
3. Deploy
* Once tuning is done, models can be deployed to SageMaker endpoints
* In the endpoints, real-time prediction is performed

## How to train a model

* The URL of S3 bucket where training data is stored
* Compute resources or ML compute instances
* The URL of S3 bucket where the output will be stores
* The path of Elastic Container Registry where the code data is saved (inference code image)
