    "In this notebook, you're going to create your first generative adversarial network (GAN) for this course! Specifically, you will build and train a GAN that can generate hand-written images of digits (0-9). You will be using PyTorch in this specialization, so if you're not familiar with this framework, you may find the [PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html) useful. The hints will also often include links to relevant documentation.\n",

    "Finally, you can put everything together! For each epoch, you will process the entire dataset in batches. For every batch, you will need to update the discriminator and generator using their loss. Batches are sets of images that will be predicted on before the loss functions are calculated (instead of calculating the loss function after each image). Note that you may see a loss to be greater than 1, this is okay since binary cross entropy loss can be any positive number for a sufficiently confident wrong guess. \n",
    "\n",
    "It’s also often the case that the discriminator will outperform the generator, especially at the start, because its job is easier. It's important that neither one gets too good (that is, near-perfect accuracy), which would cause the entire model to stop learning. Balancing the two models is actually remarkably hard to do in a standard GAN and something you will see more of in later lectures and assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you've submitted a working version with the original architecture, feel free to play around with the architecture if you want to see how different architectural choices can lead to better or worse GANs. For example, consider changing the size of the hidden dimension, or making the networks shallower or deeper by changing the number of layers.\n",
