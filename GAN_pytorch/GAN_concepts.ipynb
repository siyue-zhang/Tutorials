The zero means the normal distribution has a mean of zero, and the 1 means that the normal distribution has a variance of 1. \n",

    "## Truncation trick\n",
    "\n",
    "So now that you're a bit familiar with noise vectors, here's another cool concept that people use to tune their outputs. It's called the truncation trick. I like to think of the truncation trick as a way of trading off fidelity (quality) and diversity in the samples. It works like this: when you randomly sample your noise vector $z$, you can choose to keep that random $z$ or you can sample another one. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why would you want to sample another one? \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, since I'm sampling $z$ from a normal distribution, my model will see more of those $z$ values within a standard deviation from the mean than those at the tails of the distributionâ€”and this happens during training. This means that while the model is training, it's likely to be familiar with certain noise vectors and as a result model those areas coming from familiar noise vector regions. In these areas, my model will likely have much more realistic results, but nothing too funky, it's not taking as many risks in those regions mapped from those familiar noise vectors. This is the trade-off between fidelity (realistic, high quality images) and diversity (variety in images). \n",
    "\n",
    "What the truncation trick does is resamples the noise vector $z$ until it falls within some bounds of the normal distribution. In fact, it samples $z$ from a truncated normal distribution where the tails are cut off at different values (red line in graph is truncated normal, blue is original). You can tune these values and thus tune fidelity/diversity. Recall that having a lot of fidelity is not always the goalâ€”one failure mode of that is that you get one really real image but nothing else (no diversity), and that's not very interesting or successful from a model that's supposed to model the realm of all possible human faces or that of all possible coconutsâ€”including that of a cat pouncing after a flying coconut (but with extremely low probability)."

    "### Score and Score-Based Models\n",
    "Given a probablity density function $p(\\mathbf{x})$, we define the *score* as $$\\nabla_\\mathbf{x} \\log p(\\mathbf{x}).$$ As you might guess, score-based generative models are trained to estimate $\\nabla_\\mathbf{x} \\log p(\\mathbf{x})$. Unlike likelihood-based models such as flow models or autoregressive models, score-based models do not have to be normalized and are easier to parameterize. For example, consider a non-normalized statistical model $p_\\theta(\\mathbf{x}) = \\frac{e^{-E_\\theta(\\mathbf{x})}}{Z_\\theta}$, where $E_\\theta(\\mathbf{x}) \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is called the energy function and $Z_\\theta$ is an unknown normalizing constant that makes $p_\\theta(\\mathbf{x})$ a proper probability density function. The energy function is typically parameterized by a flexible neural network. When training it as a likelihood model, we need to know the normalizing constant $Z_\\theta$ by computing complex high-dimensional integrals, which is typically intractable. In constrast, when computing its score, we obtain $\\nabla_\\mathbf{x} \\log p_\\theta(\\mathbf{x}) = -\\nabla_\\mathbf{x} E_\\theta(\\mathbf{x})$ which does not require computing the normalizing constant $Z_\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, any neural network that maps an input vector $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ to an output vector $\\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ can be used as a score-based model, as long as the output and input have the same dimensionality. This yields huge flexibility in choosing model architectures.\n",

    "### Perturbing Data with a Diffusion Process\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to generate samples with score-based models, we need to consider a [diffusion process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_process) that corrupts data slowly into random noise. Scores will arise when we reverse this diffusion process for sample generation. You will see this later in the notebook.\n",

Their paths are like the trajectory of a particle submerged in a flowing fluid, which moves randomly due to unpredictable collisions with other particles. Let $\\{\\mathbf{x}(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^d \\}_{t=0}^T$ be a diffusion process, indexed by the continuous time variable $t\\in [0,T]$.

    "where $\\mathbf{f}(\\cdot, t): \\mathbb{R}^d \\to \\mathbb{R}^d$ is called the *drift coefficient* of the SDE, $g(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is called the *diffusion coefficient*, and $\\mathbf{w}$ represents the standard Brownian motion. You can understand an SDE as a stochastic generalization to ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Particles moving according to an SDE not only follows the deterministic drift $\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x}, t)$, but are also affected by the random noise coming from $g(t) d\\mathbf{w}$. \n",

    "### Reversing the Diffusion Process Yields Score-Based Generative Models\n",
    "By starting from a sample from $p_T$ and reversing the diffusion process, we will be able to obtain a sample from $p_\\text{data}$. Crucially, the reverse process is a diffusion process running backwards in time. It is given by the following reverse-time SDE\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",

    "where $\\bar{\\mathbf{w}}$ is a Brownian motion in the reverse time direction, and $dt$ here represents an infinitesimal negative time step. Here $p_t(\\mathbf{x})$ represents the distribution of $\\mathbf{x}(t)$. This reverse SDE can be computed once we know the drift and diffusion coefficients of the forward SDE, as well as the score of $p_t(\\mathbf{x})$ for each $t\\in[0, T]$.\n",

    "### Score Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the above intuition, we can use the time-dependent score function $\\nabla_\\mathbf{x} \\log p_t(\\mathbf{x})$ to construct the reverse-time SDE, and then solve it numerically to obtain samples from $p_0$ using samples from a prior distribution $p_T$. We can train a time-dependent score-based model $s_\\theta(\\mathbf{x}, t)$ to approximate $\\nabla_\\mathbf{x} \\log p_t(\\mathbf{x})$, using the following weighted sum of [denoising score matching](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~vincentp/Publications/smdae_techreport.pdf) objectives.\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "where $\\mathcal{U}(0,T)$ is a uniform distribution over $[0, T]$, $p_{0t}(\\mathbf{x}(t) \\mid \\mathbf{x}(0))$ denotes the transition probability from $\\mathbf{x}(0)$ to $\\mathbf{x}(t)$, and $\\lambda(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^+$ denotes a continuous weighting function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the objective, the expectation over $\\mathbf{x}(0)$ can be estimated with empirical means over data samples from $p_0$. The expectation over $\\mathbf{x}(t)$ can be estimated by sampling from $p_{0t}(\\mathbf{x}(t) \\mid \\mathbf{x}(0))$, which is efficient when the drift coefficient $\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x}, t)$ is affine. The weight function $\\lambda(t)$ is typically chosen to be inverse proportional to $\\mathbb{E}[\\|\\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}}\\log p_{0t}(\\mathbf{x}(t) \\mid \\mathbf{x}(0)) \\|_2^2]$."
